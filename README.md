## Camp Around

[Design Documentation](https://github.com/Meenakshi-Anand/Camp-around/wiki)


Camp Around is a full-stack web application inspired by HipCamp. The application allows users to discover and book unique camping experiences all over the world to satisfy their wanderlust.

WanderCamp is built on MERN(Mongo/Express/React/Node.js) stack, managed with a Mongo database, and utilizes a React and Redux architecture for the frontend. The application was built within a two-week timeframe, though I plan to continue adding features over time.
